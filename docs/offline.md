# Build Studio Offline Capability

## Overview

Build Studio is designed to work completely offline, allowing you to build and package your projects without an internet connection. All core functionality is available without requiring network access.

## Offline Features

The following features work completely offline:

1. **Local Builds** - Compile your projects using local toolchains
2. **Local Packaging** - Create packages for all supported platforms using local tools
3. **Plugin Management** - Load and use plugins from the local plugins directory
4. **Project Management** - Create, edit, and manage projects locally
5. **Configuration Management** - Read and write build configurations
6. **File Operations** - All file read/write operations

## Network-Dependent Features

The following features require network connectivity and will be disabled or have limited functionality when offline:

1. **Remote Build Nodes** - Execute builds on remote machines (SSH/RPC)
2. **CI/CD Integration** - Webhook triggers and remote repository integration
3. **Plugin Marketplace** - Downloading plugins from remote repositories (not yet implemented)
4. **Remote Package Repositories** - Publishing packages to remote repositories (not yet implemented)

## Offline Workflow

To work completely offline:

1. Ensure all required build tools are installed locally
2. Download and install any needed plugins to the local `plugins/` directory
3. Create and manage projects locally
4. Use local build and packaging commands

## Required Local Tools

For full offline functionality, ensure the following tools are installed locally:

### Build Tools
- C/C++ compiler (gcc, clang, etc.)
- Python interpreter
- Java JDK
- Rust toolchain
- Go toolchain
- Node.js
- MinGW (for Windows cross-compilation)
- Android NDK (for Android builds)
- wasm-pack (for WebAssembly builds)

### Packaging Tools
- dpkg-deb (for Debian packages)
- rpmbuild (for RPM packages)
- WIX toolset (for Windows MSI packages)
- hdiutil and pkgbuild (for macOS packages)
- Android SDK tools (for Android APK packages)

## Security in Offline Mode

When working offline, Build Studio's security features are still active:

- Sandboxing is enforced for all builds
- Command validation prevents dangerous operations
- Path restrictions limit file access
- Network isolation prevents accidental network access

## Configuration

Offline mode is the default behavior. No special configuration is required to work offline.

To enable network features when available:

1. Ensure network connectivity
2. Configure remote nodes in the application
3. Set up CI/CD webhooks as needed
