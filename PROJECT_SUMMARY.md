- ✅ Created remote repository integration
- ✅ Provided webhook state management

### 7. Remote Build Nodes
- ✅ Developed node management system (stub for SSH, HTTP RPC)
- ✅ Created build queue management
- ✅ Added node registration and listing capabilities

### 8. Security Features
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive sandboxing for all builds
- ✅ Added command validation to prevent dangerous operations
- ✅ Created path restrictions for file access
- ✅ Implemented network isolation
- ✅ Added automatic sandbox cleanup
- ✅ Provided detailed security documentation (`docs/security.md`)

### 9. Offline Capability
- ✅ Ensured complete offline functionality for core features
- ✅ Enabled local build and packaging without internet
- ✅ Implemented plugin management from local directory
- ✅ Provided comprehensive offline documentation (`docs/offline.md`)

### 10. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive Plugin SDK documentation
- ✅ Developed detailed security features documentation
- ✅ Provided offline capability documentation
- ✅ Updated README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Added configuration file format documentation

## Code Quality
