# Build Studio - Project Summary

## Overview

Build Studio is a comprehensive cross-platform build management application that provides both GUI and CLI interfaces for configuring, managing, and executing software builds across multiple platforms and languages. The application emphasizes modularity, extensibility, offline capability, and security.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Cross-Platform Support
- Supports Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and WebAssembly
- Handles multiple languages: C/C++, Python, Java, Rust, Go, Node.js
- Provides both Tauri/Svelte GUI and CLI interfaces

### 2. Build Management
- YAML/JSON configuration files for builds and packaging
- Cross-compilation support for all target platforms
- Local shell execution with real-time log streaming
- Toolchain support (MinGW, Android NDK, wasm-pack)

### 3. Plugin System
- Dynamic plugin discovery from local plugins directory
- Plugin manifest support (JSON/YAML)
- Sample plugin implementation
- Plugin SDK documentation

### 4. Packaging System
- Multi-platform package creation (deb, rpm, msi, exe, dmg, pkg, apk, wasm)
- Integration with platform-specific packaging tools
- Configuration-driven packaging

### 5. Project Management
- Project workspace management
- Metadata handling and project switching
- Configuration file management

### 6. CI/CD Integration
- Webhook management for GitHub/GitLab
- Auto-trigger capabilities
- Remote repository integration

### 7. Remote Build Nodes
- Node management (SSH, HTTP RPC)
- Build queue management
- Health checks (planned for future implementation)

### 8. Security Features
- Sandboxing for all builds
- Command validation to prevent dangerous operations
- Path restrictions for file access
- Network isolation
- Automatic sandbox cleanup

### 9. Offline Capability
- Complete offline functionality for core features
- Local build and packaging without internet
- Plugin management from local directory
- Comprehensive offline documentation

## Architecture

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- Modular design with separate modules for each feature
- Async Tauri commands with proper error handling
- State management using Mutex for thread safety
- Security module for build isolation

### Frontend (Svelte)
- Component-based UI architecture
- State management with Svelte stores
- Real-time build log display
- Responsive design for all platforms

### CLI Interface
- Command-line interface for headless operations
- Support for all core build operations
- Plugin and node management

## Documentation

- Plugin SDK documentation
- Security features documentation
- Offline capability documentation
- Configuration file format documentation
